1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,624
We pray for hope and breathe curses and protect you from the dark

2
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
We're magical girls

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,816
We traded our souls for our powers and a destiny have battle

4
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
A destiny which ends in Oblivion for the only way to escape our despair

5
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Is to vanish from this world

6
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
The end will come for all of us

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
So we continue our fight and wait for the law Cycles to lead us away

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
In this broken world

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,640
Doomed to repeat its tragedies and hatred I dreamt of someone I know

10
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
And saw her familiar smile again

11
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's morning already?

00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Good morning Kyubey

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Good morning Dad
 
12
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,431

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08:000
Mama yet?

00:05:08:000 --> 00:05:10:000
Let's get waking her up.

14
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
You might need some help

15
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
What's new in your world

16
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
He told me that doing so well

17
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Chucky been so busy it's hard for her to see him

18
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
It's going to be a big problem if they're serious about going steady

19
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Keller don't get discouraged

20
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Don't obsess

21
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095

Talked about the end of the world in class all the time

24
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Hellboy

25
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Maybe I can set her up on a blind date

26
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
I wonder why she the more popular with the guy

27
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
A lot of really cute things about her

28
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
When it comes to Menchie's at their standards really high

29
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
She doesn't want to compromise

30
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
How she is

31
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,607

32
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239

33
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
That's weird isn't it kind of late in the year for that

34
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
What's the weather like

35
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
Whoever it is I hope we can be friends

36
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487

Myblu any minute

59
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
The end of the world might not be such a bad thing

60
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
How much was man enough for one lifetime

61
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
The only thing I have to look forward to is hitting 40

62
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
Feathered all ended in one big

63
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271

It's nice to meet you

69
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
My name is Homer Academy

70
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,919
The kitty was in the hospital for a while due to a heart condition

71
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
She's been away from school for so long

72
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
So that's okay

73
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:28,031
Do you know about her how come you didn't say anything. I'm sorry I didn't I kept it a secret

74
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Because I thought it would be a fun surprise

75
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
I should have introduced myself to you last night last night

76
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,087
You mean you are waiting at the Rendezvous point with Mommy how come you didn't help us

00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
She did as a matter of fact she helped us out a lot

78
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
She had the most amazing power

79
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,887
If she works at that still boosters prank 200. I'm not really that strong but I can back you up

80
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,239
I'm not very good at attacks so well you seem pretty cool to me

81
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
And with all the big shot nightmares we've been fighting lately we need the extra help I guess after last night you proved you got what

Can you believe it's already been a month since you showed up here now I can it's like the time is it

88
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Feels like I've known you forever though

89
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,775
Hippie nice that the nightmare stayed away tonight and everyone could get a good night

90
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
If I tell you something

91
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Not to laugh

92
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
You're here and I was talking like this

93
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Feels like something I've wanted for a long time

94
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
It's weird cuz we're just talking

95
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
We're going to see each other at school tomorrow anyway

96
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
It's not weird

97
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
I feel that way too

98
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Sitting here with you

99
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
Seems like something I've wanted for a long long time

100
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
I can't game

101
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167

107
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247

Understand

110
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Schedule

111
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
There's nothing you can do about it

112
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
I know how dedicated you are to hear music

113
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
That's what I love about you

114
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
I understand

115
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Music means more than anything.

116
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
And that is what I love about

117
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Drive

118
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Fashion

00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
Whatever

120
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
I don't eat anymore

121
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255

00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,631
Hey ain't that you told me she's a pink nightmare

127
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:47,263
I guess she's having a hard time with a boyfriend like Captain oblivious it doesn't surprise me

128
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
It sounds like someone sent them moving on

129
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Maybe hijack it up to like experience

130
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743

Play-Doh Plus

154
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
Combining our powers like that

155
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,488
Biker down with a breeze

156
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
There was a moment when I thought we were in trouble though

157
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
It's best not to get too overconfident

158
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Why did he got to be such a wet

159 
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
Blanket

160
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,568
Instead of preaching you should invite us over for tea and cake

161 
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Now that's what I'm talking about

162
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:59,968
When is your friend Kyoko now that's a great idea

Who wants to come over for a fresh mints

00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
I'm running a little low on chamomile tea

165
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,664
But I think I might have just enough for one more pie

166
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Chamomile tea

167
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
Or I could make some of the echinacea tea I got the other day

168
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Do sour

169
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,512
Taste buds develop at the first grade

170
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,912
I know baby I didn't forget he'll get a special treats to

171
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368

00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
Do you want to try some of my fried chicken

00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Wondering

180
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Have things

181
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,312
The little odd to you lately

182
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
I don't know what you mean I'd like how well that's

183
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
The thing

184
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,272
Everything just seems off I got no idea what you're saying

185
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
You feeling okay

186
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,160
I guess the reason I wanted to speak to you before anyone else was

187
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
You are the one who sings the most odd to me

188
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,328
Why would I mean is compared to the impression I have of you

189
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Something about you seems different

190
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:40,288
It's like you're not the same person you used to be okay what are you trying to do here trying to pick a fight with me is that what this

191
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
Look where you living now

192
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
Spider-Man I'm crashing at scientist

193
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,016
You lose your memory all of a sudden and how long have you been at meet Aki Hara

194
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,576
I transferred in a little while before you did

195
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
When was that

196
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,952
I guess it was last year around

197
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
What did I do

198
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,752
Whatever why is it matter where did you live before you moved here

199
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:15,104
Katamino the next city over things have got pretty quiet there for me

200
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,944
So when mommy told me stuff was getting out of hand here I came over

201
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,344
Have you gone back to visit cuz Amino lately no thank you I don't got no reason to go back there

202
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Hey Kiyoko

203
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Would you do me a favor

204
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:48,640
Come to cut the minnow with me I just want to go see it that's all

205
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,736
The cities the same as you remember I promise we'll turn around and come back

206
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,064
The no no it's just me and not something else

207
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
I got no idea what your trip is girl

208
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,464
But whatever it is I don't think you're pulling my leg hair

209
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,512
Not you you're on the level

210
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
I am

211
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Well the trip won't be for nothing

212
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
I know a good ramen shops

213
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
Buy me dinner and we're even

214
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
We got a deal or what

215
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
Dinners on me.

216
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:26,176
At the next stop will be in Pasadena City

217
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:32,576
Stop

218
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
Maybe we got on the wrong bus

219
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
No way

220
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
I'm sure we got on the one for cuz Amino station

221
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
Let's catch the next bus and go back

222
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
And let's make sure it's the right one

223
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:29,152
That's the right one no mistaken

224
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,608
What's your problem

225
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
The hell's going on

226
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
We should try Walking Dead

227
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
If we go back to that

228
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Panama City

229
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,968
Was that Crossroad really this far back

230
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
No

231
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Sorry we haven't reached it by now

232
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
Something's definitely wrong

233
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:25,632
Either we missed the crossroad which I highly doubt or something else is going on here

234
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,056
What does happening cuz it's some kind of trick to keep us from leaving me Turkey Hollow City

235
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
I don't think the answer is as simple as that

236
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
My Siri

237
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
Is that nothing exists beyond the city

238
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
Really

239
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Kyogre

240
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
I'm sorry

241
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,904
Could you not tell the others for a little while

242
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
There's something I want to check first

243
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Just to be sure

244
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
Are you crazy we have to tell the others

245
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,168
I think it will be safer if we pretend we haven't discovered anything

246
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,336
How to draw attention to ourselves now will be hunted down

247
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
This is a trap make no mistake got any idea what's going on

248
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
That's why I don't want you to do anything

249
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
For now let me handle that

250
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Far as I can tell

251
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
One has trapped us is only playing with our perception

252
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,520
That was long as we play along we won't be in any danger

253
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Fine whatever you say

254
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
Maybe my memories are screwed up but I think I get where you were coming from before

255
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
Elsa

256
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
It's weird like

257
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,560
I don't remember you being as tough as your acting right now

258
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
But it doesn't surprise me either

259
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
This you the tough are you feels right

260
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,016
Am I the only one who remembers

261
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:38,240
Casting a kind of trap before a self-contained illusion a man with no

262
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
I praise the Lord and let it stray

263
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
There's no doubt about it

264
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,856
Is a labyrinth

265
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,728
The ones who spread

266
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
Bear and disaster

267
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:21,248
It's the final form a magical girl take

268
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
And she's lost hope and given in despair

269
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:33,024
I remember how hard I fought to change a cruel destiny

270
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
A repeating time over and over again

271
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
Finally thanks to one girl her sacrifice broke the cycle of Hope and despair

272
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,856
But that the world should have been led to a New Order of Things

273
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,584
However

274
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,680
It seems we've all forgotten would happen or rather

275
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
We were made to

276
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,568
Someone is trying to replace their memories of what happened with false ones

277
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
Trapped air in the spa Suite Aki Hara City

278
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Silly thing

279
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
Mind your manners at

280
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
Set the table or you're going to turn into cheese

281
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,319
So cute together

282
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Best friend

283
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,671
Even there was baby

284
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
Tagging along and being adorable

285
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,815
Baby and I have been friends for a long

286
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
What time

287
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
I met her before anyone else

288
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
We've had lots of Adventures

289
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
Do you remember how baby came to

290
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Stay with you

291
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Or when you met her

292
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,671
Baby coupons

293
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
I was just curious

294
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,191
I'm not sure the exact day but it seems like ages ago

295
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Back in those days

296
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:54,335
I was all alone the only magical girl and misaki heart City

297
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,663
The only one who comforted me and cheered me on

298
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Was baby

299
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
Without baby in my life

300
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
I would have given up the

301
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
The fight long ago

302
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
She's right Mommy

303
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,839
You're much braver and stronger than that

304
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
Not really

305
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,495
I just act confident because that's what's expected of a senior magical girl

306
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
The thing is

307
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,103
Monica and sayaka I'm coming to the road now

308
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
We even have you and she'll go to back us up to

309
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,551
I never dreamed I'd had so many friends I could rely on

310
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,367
I don't have to push myself so hard anymore

311
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
How I have helped

312
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
Now now

313
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
The nightmares have gotten stronger recently

314
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:56,031
AC4 fighting am now than I did before his now he's got more girls on the team

315
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,359
I get to work with my friends and that's always fun

316
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Well

317
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
Fighting nightmares is not supposed to be fun

318
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Don't forget that

319
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
I know what you mean though

320
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
Things are better now

321
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,255
The kind of life I used to dream about that before I meant all of you

322
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,071
We are bound by Destiny account

323
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Battling

324
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,167
Define any happiness in a life like this is incredible

325
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,727
I never imagined it would be this

326
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Nani

327
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
May I trouble you for some more

328
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Back in a bit

329
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
I have to boil some more water

330
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,887
I'm sorry

331
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,855
You can stop the charade now

332
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
I remember what you used

333
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Hear that

334
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
I know what you really are

335
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:28,447
You altered our memories entrapped Us in this fake mitakihara City

336
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,007
You can deny it all you want

337
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Baby

338
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,823
This is your doing

339
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,783
What do you want with that it's some kind of game to you

340
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,575
Is this how you have fun

341
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:08,127
Memories are so annoying

342
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:14,527
Soon as I get one back others come flooding in one after the other

343
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:24,511
I remember Mami tomoe and now she always troubles me

344
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,815
She would put on a strong front and go all out

345
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
She had stopped his heart of any of us

346
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,727
Revealing the truth is always hard with her there

347
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,519
Shattering her optimism

348
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
And it hurt me

349
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,759
I remember now and I wish I could erase the memory of all the hearts I broke

350
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,975
Why are you doing this

351
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,327
Tell me right now or I'll lend you

352
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:16,991
I was going to wait until I understood the situation but you were hurting baby and I will not stand by

353
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
I am let that happen

354
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Yes

355
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
Explain yourself

356
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,255
Why do you want to hurt baby

357
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
You're being

358
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,423
This is not the real mitakihara City

359
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:38,239
Our memories are felons none of this is real

360
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
Really now Houma.

361
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
How can you feed this thing

362
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
Everyday Day friend

363
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,663
I suppose this means you're going

364
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,503
Going to protect that I'm giving you the chance to walk away

365
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,855
If you choose not to you'll have to fight me

366
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
We know each other's moves too well but if this rate do you think you can feed me I can Outlast

367
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
We aren't getting anywhere

368
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,111
Your magic is quite fearsome

369
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:18,463
But in a fight your fool if you think you'll always have the upper hand

370
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
Please Mommy

371
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,167
Can you tell something's wrong don't you feel anything strange about yourself

372
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,567
You could have killed me but you didn't that must mean you still have some regard for my well-being but

373
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
But still you were trying to kill baby

374
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:40,735
Please try to remember she's a witch the enemy of magical girl

375
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:47,135
I don't know what you're saying witches are not our enemies the race are

376
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Free

377
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,071
That's what I've been fighting

378
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,215
What are these nightmares

379
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
What is this

380
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
What's going on

381
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
Who are you

382
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
Baby

383
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
People get mad about what I'm going to

384
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Tell you

385
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
What are you doing

386
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
Honestly

387
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,127
Were you thinking taking on mommy when she's in top form

388
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
Couldn't help getting into a fight with

389
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
I was defending my

390
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,575
I was really after I day

391
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
Right

392
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
Let me guess

393
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
You thought cuz she used to be a witch she still that way

394
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Jump to conclusions mat

395
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,791
Do you remember

396
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
Course I do

397
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
That's why I'm here

398
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
About it though

399
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:45,407
I mean why would a witch go to all the trouble of making a labyrinth big enough to hold the city if all she's going to do is keep us here

400
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,991
She's been trying to hurt us and she's not learning new victims in either

401
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,575
Do you remember wouldn't do that

402
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
It's not without the first chance you got when she

403
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,999
You would realize that if you stop to think

404
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,583
It's pretty obvious is Labyrinth supposed to sign the letter people in

405
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
The witch who made it wants to maintain the status quo in here

406
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,703
What's going on

407
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,031
Christmas who would want things to keep going on like this

408
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
NY

409
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:17,919
Start their work backwards and

410
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
Running back into your own little time again huh

411
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
That's a bad habit of yours

412
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,599
Tri-County electric too much

413
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:32,511
You think the person who trapped Us in here

414
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:38,911
Might be one of us right would it really be all that surprising if it was remember what Mommy said

415
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
About her life now

416
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,543
She said it's the happiest she's ever been so

417
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
You think she could be the one

418
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,943
Which is the final form of a magical girl

419
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
I don't know

420
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
Maybe she is maybe she hasn't

421
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,599
That sounds like something you'd say

422
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,671
Well I got you here mind if I ask you something

423
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:03,487
When you find the witch who made this Labyrinth

424
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
What you going to do with her homework

425
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,679
You're what killed her

426
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,519
Why cuz she's a witch

427
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
What are you getting at

428
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,527
Is it really so bad

429
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
I mean really

430
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,111
We don't have to kill anyone

431
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,927
You keep working together and having fun

432
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,767
Is the person who wished for a life like that so evil

433
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,303
But she deserves to die

434
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,839
All done

435
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,887
Are you siding with a witch

436
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
Like I said

437
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
They're what we become

438
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,751
Go figure I'd sympathizer

439
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
I just realized

440
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Crucial Point novel

441
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,503
The creatures mommy remember site

442
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
Where rates not witches

443
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,671
And Kilgore didn't understand the concept of Lab Rats when I mention that

444
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
Not because they forgotten about witches

445
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,303
But because neither of them knew about them in the first

446
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,935
And switches don't exist in this universe

447
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:22,079
A magical girl soul is supposed to be taken by the law Cycles before she becomes a witch

448
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
That's a concept she created

449
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
When Shiva made the world

450
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
She sacrificed

451
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
I knew it

452
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,111
You remember her too don't you

453
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Yes I do

454
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,463
And that's what bothers me

455
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,863
I should be the only one there are three people in this world

456
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
The first one is the which made the Labyrinth the second one is baby who looks

457
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,663
And the third one is you who remembers when

458
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:04,063
Come are you are you really play a comedian

459
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,463
Pokemon

460
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,023
I'm the same old site that you've always known

461
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:19,423
Transfer student

462
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:51,423
Your reflexes are impressive you certainly weren't this agile

463
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:58,079
Whatever you do next ask yourself this one question would you be okay

464
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Destroying this version of Itachi Harbor City think hard about that before you do anything

465
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,879
Just so you don't regret it later

466
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,423
Insidious Bank

467
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
An idealized World someone dreamed up

468
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,607
Mommy needed help

469
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
Sitting so I came over

470
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
I used to dream about before I met out of you

471
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:13,855
Epic really feel bad I mean really

472
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:20,255
Stream world has turned her back on her responsibility to fight The Wraith

473
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:26,655
I can't forgive anyone who do something like that magical girl

474
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,215
Keep fighting always

475
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
The price we've paid for our wishes

476
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:39,455
Our Fate was tragic one but she gave up everything to change

477
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:52,255
The sparse is wasting the sacrifice mother-gone-mad Pratt

478
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,655
I won't allow it

479
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,327
For you

480
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
Tommy's worried about you you know that

481
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
I'm okay

482
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,271
Talk like that

483
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:52,415
Some things never bugging you you can always come talk to me if you want

484
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,559
I might not be able to help you much with your problems

485
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,399
But it's way better than having to worry about them all by yourself

486
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,591
Hurts me to see you suffering so much when all I want to do is help

487
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
She would talk to me

488
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,159
I had a dream

489
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
And it scared me

490
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
In my dream

491
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
He went someplace

492
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Far away

493
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,703
Newest so far I wasn't going to be able to see you again

494
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,007
And everyone forgot about you

495
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,615
Remember do you except for me

496
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,351
Memories with you

497
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
You're right

498
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,663
That dream does sound awful

499
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:24,319
But it's okay now really I'm not going anywhere especially if it's so far away I couldn't see you

500
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:28,671
Again I never do something like that

501
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,887
You know how windy is it

502
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,727
If I did anything that makes someone as strong as you cry like this

503
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
It would break my heart

504
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Break your heart

505
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,711
I could hurt you so much

506
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,247
Course it would

507
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,903
I hate to leave you in Saiga for Mommy and Kyoko or my mom

508
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,279
He told me in our friend's request to

509
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,375
I wouldn't go if I couldn't see you guys again

510
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
I know I don't have the courage to do something like that

511
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:20,127
Even if I didn't have a choice

512
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,111
I knew it would hurt you more than anything

513
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,399
Just stopped you back then

514
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,311
No matter what I have to do

515
01:05:54,175 --> 01:06:00,319
I want you to know that when the time comes and you have to make a hard decision you will have the courage to

516
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,439
To find out there are things only you can do

517
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
Angel jets out strong

518
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
And how kind you really are

519
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,663
You probably don't remember anything either

520
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,575
I know there's a chance you might just be an illusion

521
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,647
Fake version of you someone created

522
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,975
How else could we see each other again like that

523
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,047
Stephen Mader

524
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
Tatsumi

525
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,471
I can tell you the real model

526
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:56,383
You're here and I can talk to you again and feel your kindness one more time

527
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
Thank you

528
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:05,087
Pint of ask her anything that would make me happier than I am right now

529
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
I have to go now

530
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,303
Sorry but there's something I have to do

531
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
Where are you going

532
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,687
I wonder what's going on with

533
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:41,439
Hey Homer what's going on

534
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:44,767
I was wondering do you remember

535
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,911
If I said I don't if that's something I should be worried about

536
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
You shouldn't remember them

537
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:03,711
What about Monica, do you remember her

538
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:08,319
I remember her

539
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
No

540
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,415
If things were in order you shouldn't remember her

541
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Those memories are false

542
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
This is like some kind of bad joke

543
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
For real

544
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:26,495
If I stopped and thought about it from the start it would have

545
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:32,895
Creative worlds remodel Gazette someone would have

546
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Know about Monica to begin with

547
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:45,695
I figured it out I know who rewrote our memories and Travis Miss false maitake

548
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:11,295
There's one last thing I have to confirm for sure don't worry I can do this by myself

549
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:17,695
And if I'm right I'll and everything I'm sorry I got you involved in this

550
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:30,495
There's a limit to the distance

551
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,543
Body can be away from my Soul Jam

552
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,639
HEB 100

553
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:11,871
Passengers down for the elementary school.

554
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
I'm not a magical girl anymore

555
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:43,871
How can it happen

556
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:29,439
I'm sure you didn't really want to know the truth

557
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,839
And yet you couldn't bear it if you didn't seek it out human curiosity is quite fascinating

558
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:42,239
And a logical considering you were the one searching

559
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:48,639
I was certain you'd uncover the truth eventually home that I Cami incubator

560
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,039
I should have known this could only be your doing

561
01:12:55,295 --> 01:13:01,439
Naturally now correct me if I'm wrong but you're probably wondering where your body and soul are

562
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,839
Would you like to know permit me to show you

563
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:19,615
This is outside the first mitakihara city this is the real you

564
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
In the real world

565
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:28,319
We developed in isolation field to completely can

566
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:34,207
In your soul gem we were curious to see what happens to a tainted soul gem in a closed environment

567
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:40,607
It had to be free from all external influences for the experiment wouldn't work

568
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:47,007
What is it that cleanses match

569
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:53,407
Magical girls and make them finish it's something you called a lot of Cycles well we wanted

570
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:59,807
You know what happened to whistle Jam when it's cut off from this phenomenon thanks to you we witnessed some very interesting

571
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:06,207
We observe the peculiar clothes face when they could shape its own reality as well as

572
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:12,607
Lauren trap victim now correct me if I'm wrong

573
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:19,007
But I believe this is the power of that which concept you think twice before

574
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:25,407
Your soul gem remains intact preserve buddy isolation field it's the old

575
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:31,807
Only thing keeping you from completing your transformation into a witch excuse the metaphor but you're like a chick that

576
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:38,207
It wasn't able to break out of it's shell and matured inside it that's the reason you end up creating a labyrinth

577
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:44,607
Charlie as opposed to externally under these conditions you managed to recreate a whole city inside York

578
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:51,007
Shell in other words

579
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:56,639
This is the world inside your soul gem

580
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
Interesting Theory

581
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:05,855
But it does Labrinth is isolated from the world how could anyone be lured into it it's not possible

582
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
True

583
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,671
But we need a little adjustment

584
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,767
The isolation field barrier only works in One Direction

585
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:19,679
Even though what repels interference from the outside we can allow victim to pass through but

586
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:26,079
Only if they're invited from within and you did the inviting you unconsciously chose your target

587
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:31,967
Once you let them enter they were trapped even under these limited conditions

588
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:38,623
We surmised refer to what the law of Cycles ever wanted to reach you it good

589
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:45,023
All they had to happen with for you to invite against your labyrinth then it would materialize in the form of one of your car

590
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
Target one strap we incubators would finally be able to identify and observe it

591
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,823
Then we could find out what this karmic force is that makes magical girls disappear there are several people

592
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,223
Exist in the real world and yet they seem to have existed at some point in time

593
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,623
The most interesting of these is a girl who isn't recorded in any past memory and who was into future

594
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:17,023
Possibility either even though she doesn't exist with

595
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,423
In the karmic cycles of our universe she was able to slip into your world without causing any disturbance

596
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,823
We were fortunate we didn't have to spend too much time or energy searching for it who knows how long.

597
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,223
That was taken but you saved us the trouble home and I Cami thanks to you referring to the law of Psych

598
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,623
Smart economy

599
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:49,023
If we were disappointed in anything it would be that mad economy never displayed any sign of

600
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
Having unusual power it seems to memory rewriting performed by you the master of the labyrinth

601
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,031
Affected her as well she not only forgot the reason she entered

602
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
To save you

603
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,895
She also lost sight of who she really was and her capabilities

604
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,295
So we couldn't do anything to her

605
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,495
On one hand madoka kaname forgot she was a God and

606
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:36,895
The other you forgot you were a witch because of that we incubators could only watch as this point

607
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:43,295
Listen Deborah on folded we were fine waiting patiently in observing but since you discovered the truth

608
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:49,695
The delicate balance within your world has started to crumble

609
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:56,095
Reach out to Mark economy for help if you do that it will make her remember who she really is

610
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:02,495
And what you came here to do tell me what your real goal is incubator

611
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:08,639
Of course the law of Cycles has been a hypothesis up to this point now we can observe it

612
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,711
For what purpose

613
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,783
Satisfying curiosity is illogical

614
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:21,183
You said so yourself so I can't believe you go to such lengths just to confirm modify exist

615
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
I won't deny it

616
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:44,479
With our end goal in this whole Affair it would have been a long and difficult Endeavor though after all

617
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:50,879
The phenomenon has been a complete mystery to us we can't very well interfere with something when we can confirm

618
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:57,279
True

619
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:03,679
If we could we could interfere with it and if we can interfere with it we can control it the

620
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:10,079
Can we collect from that would allow us to conquer the law of Cycles completely then we could make a magical girls

621
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:16,479
Turn into witches energy all-in-one go your hope and despair are the key

622
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,879
The phase change between those emotion creates huge amounts of energy

623
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:29,279
You magical girls at the Gateway to Limitless possibility in our humble opinion

624
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:35,679
You should all conclude Your Existence by transforming into witches

625
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:42,079
Why are you angry because nothing to do with you anymore Your Existence has reached its completion

626
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
And now at the end of your life you could change your wish to meet the one person you waited so long for it

627
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,879
I should think you'd be happy about that hardly I have anything

628
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
You can't be serious you're creating a Curt what are you thinking it's running too fast for purified

629
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
As you are now he won't know that but you said the reason I chose

630
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:20,480
Become a magical girl lets it save Mother God

631
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:26,880
You want me to betray her but I'd rather turn

632
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:33,280
12 weeks before I get you and I will never let you incubator touch her again

633
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,680
You willing to give up your salvation for her

634
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:46,080
If you do you'll spend the rest of Eternity living among all these curtain not at all

635
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:52,480
In fact I'll make sure that the Labyrinth will be my grave Mami tomoe in Yokosuka

636
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:58,880
What are both here I have faith in them

637
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
Have any idea what it would mean if you died inside the isolation field you won't be able to break out of the shell

638
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:11,680
New transforming pool which inside a day if you're trapped in there's a lot of Cycles won't since you will be destroyed

639
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:18,080
And your soul no one will be able to save it from despair you lose your chance to see my tackle tournament again

640
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:24,480
You can't want that would you shut up already

641
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:37,280
I can't believe you prefer the worst possible face

642
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:43,680
Honestly I can't comprehend why human thought is so illogical

643
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
So that is being a witch

644
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,224
My emotions have all come back to haunt me again

645
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,424
I can't run

646
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,824
Amber anything anymore just glimmers of light and Rick Ross

647
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,024
Yes

648
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,424
My despair

649
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,224
I just want to say thank you for coming here

650
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:38,624
I can't even say goodbye

651
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:50,816
A witch

652
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:56,448
You don't have to be scared of her she looks horrible but she's the one who's suffering here

653
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
It's like a bad joke

654
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,288
Wait a moment

655
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,896
Really going to fight your friends are you

656
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,432
UK

657
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,016
I had no idea you could talk

658
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,112
It's unfortunate QB

659
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,672
But we have to trust with babies told us

660
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,232
Model Collison

661
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,024
You have the power to save her

662
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,352
All you have to do is acknowledge the real power inside you

663
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,936
Don't listen to a Monica

664
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,472
It'll be fine

665
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,776
You'll see just what I told you earlier

666
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,824
It's okay Houma. We're not going to let you go on like this

667
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,224
Promise

668
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:25,024
What are you buy a gun I one spot help

You are so focused on you never noticed that

672
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,024
Where was the only way we could work without you interfering

673
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,424
The two of you are actually part of the log cycle no not exactly

674
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,824
Make her private secretary job with a hang on to all of Monica's memories and Howard

675
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:16,224
I saw this backup and she's mine it seems my better one of us didn't make it there

676
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,624
It'll be someone to return Monica's Memory Care

677
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,024
Finding the three of us in here to say informative play Overkill to me

678
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:35,424
Naruto's back for sure

679
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,824
Yeah but it's for her real good so it's worth the trip besides she fought hard

680
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,224
Keep the world safe to Stephen Hurd the least we can do

681
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
Can I modify

682
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,576
It's time we got to work

683
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:38,912
Pomodoro

684
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:45,312
Quit being so stubborn. Already

685
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:51,712
Man what the hell do you guys got me into

686
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:58,112
Marigot thanks a lot I had a horrible dream about you last night

687
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,672
You were dead

688
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:07,072
But it wasn't a dream it was real wasn't this right here

689
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,864
Fighting side-by-side

690
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:15,520
This is the dream

691
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:20,384
It'd be sad if it were but it's not like that not really

692
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:27,296
I thought I didn't have any regrets when I died but the truth is when I found

693
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:33,696
Mad about this assignment I jumped at the chance to come back cuz in the end

694
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:40,096
I did have one regret you I miss you

695
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:46,496
Looking back if I want to see one more time thanks a lot

696
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:52,896
Kill the mood

697
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:22,496
Wesley backpack feel open you'll be free if the incubators don't have a hold on you you can reach the outside

698
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:28,896

699
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,376
I told you

700
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,168
You shouldn't go off by yourself

701
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:59,104
Whatever happened to you good or bad you're still you and I would never abandon you

702
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,432
So don't give up

703
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,152
Long as I could have you back

You ready

706
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,144
You're not scared are you

707
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,448
I'm fine

708
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,496
I'm not afraid

709
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
I'm ready

710
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,960
Talking baby

711
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,544
They're gone just like that

712
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,600
Not yet

713
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,488
They're helping Monica take home or away

714
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,096
Is that

715
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,888
Madoka kaname

716
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,240
She's the love Cycles in one day

717
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
She'll take us to

718
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:56,000
I remember the reason I'm here to get home at

719
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:02,400
Can't believe I forget something

720
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,984
They have some unnecessary interference

721
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,776
What a trip

722
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:11,616
Talk about spinning are real that was kind of annoying

723
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:24,672
He waited for me all the time

724
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,536
I'm sorry it took so long but I'm here now

725
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,400
X + 1

726
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,216
And now I'm we'll be together

727
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,544
Until know how long

728
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,592
I've waited

729
01:35:54,112 --> 01:36:00,256
I got you

730
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:13,056
Hypnotic art

731
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:25,856
I don't expect you to understand no one in the world could possibly understand

732
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:32,256
Piximotion is mine and mine alone and I've been saving it for her

733
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:51,456
It has to be this way

734
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
I'm never going to let you go again...

735
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,584
The world is being Rewritten

736
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:16,192
Is this mean a new principal has been born into this universe

737
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,288
You don't remember the last time this happened to you

738
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,360
What is the second timer

739
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
What's happening

740
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,200
Academy

741
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,992
What are you meddling in

742
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,296
You're changing something but what

743
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
I don't believe it

744
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:39,232
You're tainted soul gem should have disappeared with your soul

745
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
What happened

746
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
Why

747
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Because

748
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,400
I remembered why I repeated time

749
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,704
Over and over again

750
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,616
They run so deep even pain has become precious to me

751
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,784
What is

752
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,880
Something you can't understand

753
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:15,072
It is the Pinnacle of all human emotion

754
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,104
Then what are you you're not a magical girl

755
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:33,504
Anymore but you're not transforming into a witch either

756
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:39,904
I'm not a magical girl or a boy

757
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:46,304
And I told her from heaven so if you want to know

758
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,704
If anything you can call me it's even now

759
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:59,104
There's no doubt now trying to put human emotions to use is just too dangerous for us

760
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:05,504
We could never hope to control something whose final form is so irrational is that so

761
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:11,904
The tractors that are spread across our world

762
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:18,304
Incubator

763
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,632
You're going to die

764
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:28,032
And you babe

765
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
Hey

766
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,192
Do you have any idea what you

767
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Done

768
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
I do

769
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,544
But if you'd like to share your thoughts

770
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Please

771
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
Enlighten me

772
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Okay

773
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,688
You broke off a piece of a lot cycle

774
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:14,272
Hippie only salvation of magical girls had

775
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,832
I only took a tiny sliver of

776
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,112
That's all

777
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,928
The piece that used to be Monica

778
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,976
Before she cease to exist

779
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,352
For some reason you were all pulled in with her

780
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,680
And now you can't return to where you came from either

781
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,752
You have no right to screw everything up like this

782
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:39,104
I'm inexistent call the evil now

783
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:43,968
And if evil is supposed to distract the Divine and be a force of Chaos

784
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,296
It's only natural for me to accept the loss of a god

785
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,600
Oh yeah

786
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:53,952
What are you doing next story everything

787
01:42:54,464 --> 01:43:00,608
After other race have been wiped out perhaps I will

788
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:05,216
When that day come I suppose I can be your enemy then

789
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:10,592
The question is will you be able to stand up against me

790
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:16,480
You're having a hard time remembering things aren't you

791
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,280
I think I remember being part of something

792
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,584
Some kind of being

793
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,888
What power bigger than this world

794
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:38,752
I can't remember what it was anymore

795
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,848
All I know is I'm not supposed to be here

796
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,432
You're getting another chance at being human again

797
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,248
If anything you should be happy about that

798
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:52,576
Eventually life here will seem natural to you

799
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:54,880
And you'll forget all about the path

800
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,184
She going to fight you

801
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
There's one thing I won't forget

802
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,792
You, that Kelly

803
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,584
Demon

804
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,168
We should pretend to be on good terms

805
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,472
If you're always attacking me

806
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:13,824
Monica might end up hating you

807
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,480
How you doing

808
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,528
Good morning psychic sleep well

809
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,088
Yeah

810
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
Hey guys

811
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,744
How's it going

812
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,816
Are you okay sorry

813
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:40,448
I don't know I guess when I saw you guys

814
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,008
And heard people say good morning again

815
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
Super happy

816
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,592
Battle

817
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,456
How do you say the most mysterious things

818
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,784
Yep that's the original International

819
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:17,824
Welcome to our new classmate

820
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,848
Anime

821
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:25,248
Come on Inn

822
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:40,352
Do we have to move there

823
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:46,752
Another word back he'll be starting school here today

824
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,944
Keep it out of the country for so long

825
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,968
Adjusting

826
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,368
Hey I was wondering

827
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
America

828
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:09,536
What's a cool over there I bet it was huh I wish I could go

829
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,264
You guys

830
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,848
Can't you see you're making her nervous bombarding her with questions

831
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,384
Why don't you give her a mon

832
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
Oh yeah

833
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,040
I'm hungry but I can't

834
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,320
Nice to meet you

835
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,344
Academy

836
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,416
May I call you mother pants

837
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,512
If you don't mind

838
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,560
I'd like to show you the campus now

839
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Follow me please

840
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:55,360
Tell me how much

841
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,112
Showing me around

842
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,904
How does it feel to be back in

843
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,768
Everything feels familiar

844
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,072
Epistane timer

845
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,144
Strange

846
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,960
I'm not surprised it's been 3 years

847
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,440
Feels like nothing's changed at all

848
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,976
In fact

849
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:48,352
Everything's changed around here it's me

850
01:47:55,776 --> 01:48:01,920
Hit me should have a different form different

851
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,192
It's okay

852
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,496
Exactly what you should be

853
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,504
Madoka kaname

854
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,064
You treasure the world you live in

855
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,880
Would you break it the law to follow your heart

856
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,864
To treasure this world

857
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,216
But I don't think a person to go and break the rules

858
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,264
Because they feel like it

859
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
Well then

860
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:04,896
Supposed

861
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,944
You will also be my enemy

862
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,272
I don't care

863
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,856
I'll keep wishing for a world where you can be happy

864
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
I knew it

865
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
They always did look better on you

866
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:33,216
The weather
